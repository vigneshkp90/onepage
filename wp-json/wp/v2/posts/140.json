I love the feel and sophistication of its superiority. I like people with a keen mind and at the same time easy to talk to. These qualities can be combined perfectly natural. However, things like people look miserable, if these properties are connected to them artificially.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Modern design and a lack of love dilettantism. Looking for such&nbsp;<a href=\"#\">designers<\/a>, which all use a little beauty and no matter how much they looked around either; which you always want to do something else. Designers do not only&nbsp;<a href=\"#\">image-makers<\/a>, but also dreamers who tell stories and think. For me, all the things a good story is more important than its form.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>The designer must be an interpreter, and real and virtual needs must anticipate those questions of people that they do not think, and suddenly opened in the already created objects.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"><p>For me, the design \u2014 it is the quality of life.

We need to understand what the customer wants, and to connect it with your wishes and possibilities. To create something outstanding, we need the enthusiasm of both. I am a very happy person, because I worked with wonderful customers who have helped me very.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li>Design \u2014 is not how the object looks, but how it works.<\/li><li>Good design \u2014 is innovative.<\/li><li>A good design \u2014 is as little design as possible.<\/li><li>Good design \u2014 aesthetic.<\/li><\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>Think about the content that you want to invest in a created object, and only then will form.
